# Chapter 1
## 1.1: What is AI
- Turning Test
	- A computer that has the following attributes will **participate** in the test
		- Natural Language Processing, to communicate successfully
		- Knowledge Representation, to store what it knows/hears
		- Automated Reasoning, to answer questions and draw new conclusions
		- Machine Learning, to adapt new circumstances and to detect + extrapolate patterns
		- Optional
			- The total turing test requires CV, Speech recognition and Robotics in order to better fool the test observer
	- Test Details
		- Observer is placed in a room
		- One human and One AI are placed in another room as players, both can communicate with the observer. The observer cannot see either of them.
		- Observer and Players take turns communicating with each other or completing assigned tasks. The AI and Human player take turns answering the observer
		- The concept is that the AI must be able to fool the observer into thinking that it was the human player all along
	- Issues with the test
		- Imitation of life is not the goal of AI. The goal is to understand how intelligence in organisms works in order to use that concept in AI
