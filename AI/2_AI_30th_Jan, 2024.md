# Project: AutoDuster
- Software
	- Figure out what part of the board has stuff written on it and mark it for cleaning.
	- Constraint: Do not clean parts of the board that are already clean
- Hardware
	- Figure it out

### What components might be considered in building an intelligent computer
- Fast hardware
- Secure software
- Image recognition
- Decision Making
- Algorithms
- Examples
	- Chess engines
		- DeepBlue, AlphaZero,
	- Speech interaction, consists of
		- Speech synthesis
		- Speech recognition
		- Speech understanding?

#### Can we build hardware as complex as the brain?
- How complex is our brain
- How complex can we make computers
- Computers learn and adapt


#### Can computers "see"?
- Recognition vs Understanding
	- "Computers only see what we let them see"
	-  Mostly no as computers can see objects under limited circumstances but under certain constrained problems they can see the objects
- Benchmarking a Computer Vision application
	- Dataset => Caltech-101/256

#### AI Applications
- Assisted Driving
	- Self driving cars
		- HW: Look into WAYMO & STANLEY
- Speech Recognition
- Autonomous planning and scheduling
- Text analysis & NLP
	- HW: Do human translators exist behind an AI translator in a conference meeting
- Robotics
	- HW: PackBot
- Spam Detection
	- HW: AI Counselor?
- Computer Vision
	- Action Recognition
	- Object Detection
