# Lecture 7 - Enumeration
### What is Enumeration
- Internally Conducted, attacker/scanner has to be part of the network i.e. the environment is an intranet.
	- Discover hosts and services available on the network
	- Create NULL Sessions where a connection is established but not authenticated to extract info. For example, SV scans from nmap to get OS info
- Involves the attacker creating active connections and performing directed queries to gain more info on the target
- Looking for
	- Usernames
	- Groups
	- Machine Names
	- Network Resources
	- Services Running
	- Routing Tables
	- Auditing Services
	- Applications
	- DNS & SNMP info
### How does enumeration work | Techniques of enumeration
- Email/Business Cards
	- Getting an email ID can reveal the username and the domain name of the target
- Windows Groups
	- 
- Default Passwords
- SNMP
- Brute Force AD
- DNS Zone transfers
