# Chapter 1 is insanely boring. Here's the summary
### Q/A
1. Digital forensics and data recovery refer to the same activities. False.
2. Police in the United States must use procedures that adhere to which of the following? b. Fourth Amendment
3. The triad of computing security includes which of the following? c. Vulnerability/threat assessment and risk management, network intrusion detection and incident response, and digital investigation
4. What’s the purpose of maintaining a network of digital forensics specialists? The purpose of maintaining a network of digital forensics specialists is to ensure timely and effective response to digital incidents, such as cyber attacks or data breaches, and to provide expertise in investigating and analyzing digital evidence.
5. Policies can address rules for which of the following? d. Any of the above
6. What are two items that should appear on a warning banner?
- A warning banner should typically include a notice that the system is for authorized users only and a warning that unauthorized access is prohibited.
7. Under normal circumstances, is a private-sector investigator considered an agent of law enforcement? False.
- A private-sector investigator is not typically considered an agent of law enforcement under normal circumstances.
8. Name two types of digital investigations typically conducted in a business environment.
- Two types of digital investigations commonly conducted in a business environment are internal investigations for employee misconduct or policy violations and forensic investigations for incidents such as data breaches or cyber attacks.
9. Define professional conduct and explain its importance.
- Professional conduct refers to the ethical behavior, integrity, and adherence to standards expected in a particular profession. It's important because it builds trust with clients, maintains the reputation of the investigator and their organization, and ensures fairness and legality in investigations.
10. What is the purpose of an affidavit?
- The purpose of an affidavit is to provide evidence or support for a legal proceeding or to establish facts in a case by presenting a sworn statement of facts written by an individual under oath.
11. What are the necessary components of a search warrant?
- The necessary components of a search warrant typically include the specific location to be searched, the items or evidence to be seized, probable cause for the search, the signature of a judge or magistrate, and the date issued.
12. How can you determine the resources needed for an investigation?
- Determining the resources needed for an investigation involves assessing factors such as the scope and complexity of the case, the expertise required, available budget and personnel, technological tools needed, and legal considerations.
13. What are three items that should be on an evidence custody form?
- Three items that should be on an evidence custody form are a description of the evidence, the date and time it was collected, and the signature of the person collecting and transferring the evidence.
14. Why should you do a standard risk assessment to prepare for an investigation?
- Conducting a standard risk assessment before an investigation helps identify potential risks, threats, and challenges that could impact the investigation's success. It allows investigators to prepare mitigation strategies and allocate resources effectively.
15. Should you always prove the allegations made by the person who hired you? False.
- It's not necessary to prove the allegations made by the person who hired you. Instead, investigators should focus on gathering objective evidence and reaching impartial conclusions based on facts.
16. For digital evidence, is an evidence bag typically made of antistatic material? True.
- True. An evidence bag for digital evidence is typically made of antistatic material to prevent static electricity from damaging the electronic components.
17. Why should evidence media be write-protected?
- Evidence media should be write-protected to prevent any unauthorized alteration, deletion, or addition of data, preserving the integrity and admissibility of the evidence in legal proceedings.
18. What are three items that should be in your case report?
- Three items that should be in a case report are a detailed description of the investigation process, findings of the investigation supported by evidence, and conclusions or recommendations based on the findings.

### Summary
- Digital forensics involves applying forensic procedures to digital evidence for use in legal cases. It differs from network forensics and data recovery.
- Laws governing digital evidence were established in the 1970s.
- Successful digital forensics investigators need familiarity with multiple computing platforms and networking professionals.
- Specialized workstations with additional drive bays, forensics software, and write blockers are essential for investigators.
- Public-sector investigations require a search warrant, while private-sector cases focus on policy violations and asset abuse.
- Warning banners remind employees of company policies on computer and internet use.
- Companies should limit authorized requesters for investigations.
- Professional conduct is crucial for digital forensics investigators.
- Systematic approaches and checklists guide investigations.
- Planning involves considering case nature, requester instructions, necessary tools, and evidence acquisition.
- Both criminal cases and policy violations require similar handling for presenting quality evidence in court.
- Contingency planning is vital for addressing unexpected challenges in investigations.
- Standard evidence custody forms track evidence chain of custody.
- Internet abuse investigations involve analyzing server log data.
- Attorney-client privilege cases require labeling written communication appropriately.
- Bit-stream copies, duplicates of original disks, are preferred for analysis.
- Maintaining a journal helps track evidence handling.
- Self-critique improves investigation methods for future cases.
