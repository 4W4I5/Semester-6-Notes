# Chapter 1 is insanely boring. Read the book on your own.
### Summary
- Digital forensics applies forensics procedures to digital evidence. This process involves systematically accumulating and analyzing digital information for use as evidence in civil, criminal, and administrative cases. Digital forensics differs from network forensics and data recovery in scope, technique, and objective.
-  Laws relating to digital evidence were established in the 1970s.
-  To be a successful digital forensics investigator, you must be familiar with more than one computing platform. To supplement your knowledge,
develop and maintain contact with computer, network, and investigative professionals.
- Investigators need specialized workstations
to examine digital evidence, including
additional bays for evidence drives,
forensics software, and write blockers.
- Public-sector and private-sector
investigations differ, in that public-sector
investigations typically require a search
warrant before seizing digital evidence. The
Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution
and similar legislation in other countries
apply to government search and seizure.
During public-sector investigations, you
search for evidence to support criminal
allegations. During private-sector
investigations, you search for evidence to
support allegations of policy violations,
abuse of assets, and, in some cases,
criminal complaints.


Warning banners should be used to remind
employees and visitors of company policy
on computer, e-mail, and Internet use.
• Companies should define and limit the
number of authorized requesters who can
start an investigation.
• Digital forensics investigators must
maintain professional conduct to protect
their credibility.
• Always use a systematic approach to your
investigations. Follow the checklist in this
chapter as a guideline for your case.
• When planning a case, take into account
the nature of the case, instructions from
the requester, what additional tools and
expertise you might need, and how you
will acquire the evidence.
• Criminal cases and company-policy
violations should be handled in much
the same manner to ensure that quality
evidence is presented. Both criminal cases
and company-policy violations can go to
court.
• When you begin a case, there might be
unanticipated challenges that weren’t
obvious when applying a systematic
approach to your investigation plan. For

all investigations, you need to plan for
contingencies for any unexpected problems
you might encounter.
• You should create a standard evidence
custody form to track the chain of custody
of evidence for your case. There are two
types of forms: a multi-evidence form and
a single-evidence form.
• Internet abuse investigations require
examining server log data.
• For attorney-client privilege cases, all
written communication should have a
header label stating that it’s privileged
communication and a confidential work
product.
• A bit-stream copy is a bit-by-bit duplicate
of the original disk. You should use the
duplicate, whenever possible, when
analyzing evidence.
• Always maintain a journal to keep notes
on exactly what you did when handling
evidence.
• You should always critique your own work
to determine what improvements you
made during each case, what could have
been done differently, and how to apply
those lessons to future cases.
