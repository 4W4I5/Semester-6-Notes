Forensics is the application of CS and investigate procedures for a legal purpose involving the analysis of digital evidence after a proper search authority, chain of custody, validation with mathematics use of validated tools, repeatability, reporting and possible expert presentation

Chain of custody links evidence, when it was gathered, stored, reanalyzed. It basically tracks all evidence states and time of change of state.

Validation w mathematics:

Use of validated tools: custom tools not allowed

Repeatability: Results should be repeatable

Reporting: All evidence gathered must be submitted, none withheld, Follow legal format. Relevant comments must be included in as well. Personal opinions must not be reported/presented.

Understanding computer forensics
- Search warrants are needed for forensics
	- Example: 4th Amendment, From search & seizure: Protect everyones rights to be secure in their person, residence and property
	- Example: Copenhefer Case
		- Add in details later but the general gist is during an investigation. Privacy/Transparency does not matter. In fact both the analyst and the suspected are required to be transparent.

Forensics vs other related disciplines
- Computer forensics
	- Only computer related i.e evidence retried from a computers hDD or other media
	- Evidence can be inculpatory/exculpatory i.e incriminating
- Network forensics
	- Evidence pertaining to how the attacker gained access to a network
- Data Recovery
	- Recovering information deleted by mistake/on purpose
- Disaster Recovery
	- Use of forensics to retrieve data lost in a disaster
- Enterprise Network Environment
	- Large Corporate computing systems ha
- VARE Group
	- Tests/verifies the integrity of standalone workstations and network servers
	- Professionals in this group have skills in network ID/IR
- Litigation
	- Legal process of proving guilt/innocence in court
- Computer investigations group
	- Manages investigations & conducts forensics analysis blah blah

Law & resources

Understanding case law
- Technology is evolving at an exponential pace
- Case used when statues/regulations do not exist
- Case allows legal counsel to use previous cases similar to the current one
- Each case is evaluated on its own merit and issues
